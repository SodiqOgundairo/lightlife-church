                    LLC is not just a place, it is a people. It is a community
                    where sinners, the destitute, the despondent, the rejected,
                    the depressed, the confused, the hurting people can find
                    salvation, love, hope joy, purpose, peace, acceptance and
                    guidance. LLC is a place for growing and grooming believers
                    into maturity through intentional teaching of the undiluted
                    revelation of the Scripture. We believe that when Christ is
                    unveiled, Saints are empowered. It is a place of equipping
                    and empowering believers for the end time global harvest and
                    also preparing saints for the age to come. We believe that
                    our core responsibility is not to raise members but
                    disciples.

                            Lightlife church is a New Testament church. We believe in

                            Pastors and Teachers. We believe that for a church to be
                            equipped, matured and come to the fullness of Christ, it
                            must embrace and manifest all the five-fold ministry gifts.

                              We also believe that every believer is called to ministry
                              to serve through their ministerial gifts. Also, we believe
                              that every believer is born to be a leader. However, we
                              lead by serving others. We take pleasure in serving and
                              not being served. Matthew 20:24-28.

                  We believe that the core purpose of Christ’s coming is to
                  bring men (male & females) into God’s kingdom ( Matthew
                  4:17,28:19, Mark 16:14, Luke 9:60, Hebrews 2:10). As a New
                  Testament church, Jesus as commanded us to GO out and make
                  Disciples of all nations through the preaching of the Gospel
                  of Grace. Also, to shine as light in the midst of darkness
                  (John 1:6-9, Matthew 5:13-14).
