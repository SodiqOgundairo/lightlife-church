You cannot live a fulfilling life if you don’t understand His will for you. There is no way you can obey God when you can't simply discern what His will for you is.

I remember while growing up, one of the phrases our parents used to tell us especially when travelling far away from home was “Remember whose son you are”. This phrase means to protect the good name of the family. Good name is better than riches. The Bible says that those who want to be rich fall into divers temptations. If you have a desperate hunger for money, you will do things that will destroy your character and name.",

He got the best hall in town with the best musicians. But nobody showed up because no one wanted to be associated with him.",
