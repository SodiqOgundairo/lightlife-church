Some see it just as a religious manual. Some see it as a mysterious book that cannot be understood. The greatest way the devil fights us is by influencing how we get to see the bible. ",

Many think the scripture is about Christ, it is correct but not very correct. The scripture is about you. Jesus doesn’t need the word to function, but you do.

My answer is, does feeling bad and guilty about your sins take it away? You see, when you sin, and you are disappointed in yourself, sometimes, you curse yourself, some even go to the extent of hurting themselves. You do this because you have put confidence in your flesh initially. Don’t hide when you sin. That was the mistake of Adam. Just come confidently to the throne of grace and obtain mercy for forgiveness and grace for empowerment. The condemnation of your heart most times does not lead to repentance. It makes you run away from God. When you have trained yourself not to condemn you, that’s when you have confidence in the righteousness of God.",

A lot of young folks out there believe that as long as they are born again they do not need to belong to any local church, submit to a spiritual head, or serve under a ministry.

If all you do is the online church and you do not participate in any system of the church, your growth will be very limited. Serving God as a believer is what helps your spiritual growth. Most times, what makes many believers run away from serving in their local church is pride. If you are too proud to serve, you are too small to lead. Don’t be too proud to do the little things in the church. Some are so full of rhema that once their pastor does not give them a role on the pulpit, they are too big to serve in other systems like sanitation, welfare, media, or any places where they can’t be seen.",

Labouring in the vine is part of serving and working with others.  Though we are sons, we are also servants of God. Paul noted that one of the signs of spiritual maturity is serving as a teacher in the church. To grow, commit yourself to serve in a local church. Submit to a spiritual head to whom you are accountable. Find a department in the church to work with. Use your gifts and skills for the furtherance of the church.

Many believers do not prosper today despite their belief in God. But please note that your prosperity lies in the honour you give to the anointed. I recently visited one of our first-timers in her restaurant. She was so excited to see me. She received me well and gave me gifts when I was leaving.

If you want to receive what God has sent your pastor to give you, you must close your hearts to his errors and focus on honouring him. Honouring your Man of God is your legal obligation, not a choice. It is the key to your prosperity. It is your access to receiving the grace that he carries.

Second, always come to the office before your boss or anyone for that matter. Be the first to be at meetings, and don't always give excuses for late coming.

Sixth, bless your boss with a gift from your salary once in a while. After your salary is sent to you, send your boss a recharge card and thank them. I know it’s your salary and you worked for it, but I'm showing you how to stand out and get favour in difficult times. Lastly, be real. Do all these things from your heart. Don’t do eye service.

To be significant means to be important and to stand out or to be worthy of note. This is your destiny. No matter your past or background, God wants you to live a life of significance. But how do I begin my journey to significance? It’s simple, the foundational principle is to know the most significant figure in history, in the person of Jesus. I was a nobody until I met Jesus. Immediately I met Him and began my journey with Him, people began to notice me and the value I carry.",

You become aware of the treasure and value you carry. Simply yourself, the perception will change. Secondly, your world perception will also change. You suddenly begin to see opportunity and open doors for greatness everywhere you go. On your path to significance is self-development and personal productivity. You must learn how to push yourself to do the things that you need to do. You must learn to work very hard and be disciplined. The reason a lot of believers could not rise to the place of significance is because of a lack of discipline. ",

Your significance is measured by how much you have contributed to people's lives, your society, and the world at large. Prophet Samuel, Elijah, King David, Paul, and the rest of the great people are significant not because of what they did for themselves but what they did for God and humanity. The journey of significance is often traveled on the road of sacrifice and meaningful contribution. To be significant you must do something significant.",

What this means is that the secret to please your husband is knowing what he wants in the first place. One of the major challenges of many believers is understanding the will of God for their lives. There is God’s will concerning all areas of your life. God is not only interested in your spiritual life alone, there is God’s will for your marriage, education, career, business, choice of friends, where you live, and all other areas of your life. You cannot live a fulfilling life if you don’t understand His will for you. There is no way you can obey God when you can't simply discern what His will for you is. This is why many believers today just do guesswork. They keep trying one thing to another, guessing what they think God will want them to do. God doesn't want us to guess or assume as regards His will. He wants us to be sure.",

However, God did not leave us without clearly stating what His will is for every area of our lives. Don’t do guesswork when His will for you is plainly written in His word. Most believers can’t figure out God’s will due to their immaturity in Christ. Remaining a babe in Christ makes your spiritual senses underdeveloped. Don't be deceived, being born again does not release to you all that you are in Christ. It gives you access but you must develop some spiritual stamina to be able to take them.",

The job might have great pay but is it the will of God for you? A mature believer knows that because it is good doesn't mean that God is in it.

This must be your prayer and your pursuit too, to know God’s will. It is impossible to please God without knowing His will. You can either follow your own will, follow the devil's will, or decide to follow God’s will. Each one comes with its own consequences.

The will of God may not always be comfortable or easy but it sure leads to success. The will of God is not a mystery to a believer anymore.

The moment you surrender your life to Jesus, the Spirit of Christ in you clearly reveals what His will is to you. The Holy Spirit is the one that declares the will of God to you here on earth. This is why you must cultivate an intimate fellowship with the person of the Spirit.  However, are you ready to submit to His will? The true sign of brokenness as a believer is the ability to submit your will to God's will. Jesus demonstrated this and laid an example for us to follow.
