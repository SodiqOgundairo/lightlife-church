            "Dear Family, HAPPY NEW YEAR! I want to officially welcome you to the year 2025. What a blessing to be part of the people that overcame 2023 and its dangers. Despite all the evil in the previous year, none of them is powerful enough to stop you from seeing the new year. I want you to know that it is a privilege supplied through the grace of God for you to be part of the people celebrating the new year. As we turn the page to this fresh chapter, we find ourselves filled with new hopes, opportunities, and possibilities. A new year is a moment to reflect on where we've been and to set our hearts toward where we want to go. It’s a time to realign ourselves with God's calling and seek His guidance for the road ahead.This year, I want to encourage you to focus on five powerful pillars that will not only shape your personal journey but also deepen your walk with God: Focus, Resilience, Diligence, Purity, and Prayer.",

            "As we step into the new year, it's easy to be distracted by all the celebration. Yet, one of the most powerful things we can do in 2025 is choose to focus on what truly matters: our relationship with God, our family, our calling, and our personal growth (Hebrews 12:2,). Let this focus guide your decisions, your actions, and your heart.Resilience is the ability to bounce back after facing trials, setbacks, and hardships. The year ahead will likely bring both joy and struggles, but what matters most is how we respond. Life will test us, but it is in those moments that God builds our resilience, our strength to endure and rise above. (Romans 5:3-4) ",

            "In a world that often seeks shortcuts and instant gratification, diligence is the key to seeing lasting fruit. Diligence is about committing to the process, working hard with integrity, and giving your best, even when the results aren't immediately visible. It’s not about working harder but about working smarter, with a heart that is fully invested in God's calling for your life. (Proverbs 12:24) ",

          textFour:
            "Purity is about living with integrity and guarding our hearts and minds from the influences that seek to pull us away from God. In a world full of distractions, temptations, and confusion, maintaining purity requires intentionality and surrenderness to God’s will (Psalm 119:9). Living with purity is not just about avoiding sin; it's about filling our hearts with what is good, pure, and holy. ",

          textFive:
            "Lastly, prayer is the cornerstone of our relationship with God. Prayer keeps us aligned with His will, strengthens us in our weaknesses, and invites His power into every area of our lives. In 2025, let prayer be your daily rhythm, your breath, and your foundation. (Philippians 4:6-7). Prayer isn’t just about asking; it’s about listening, connecting, and aligning our hearts with God’s purposes.",

But I realized that the act of gathering together in God's presence was far more important than perfection. So, I shared the idea with my husband. To my surprise, he was on board. We decided to start small: five minutes of Bible reading and prayer each evening. We weren’t looking for some grand spiritual awakening, just a commitment to prioritize God together.",

Our children, once indifferent to spiritual things, started asking questions about the Bible. They began to pray with more sincerity, even outside of our altar time. My husband and I found ourselves bonding over Scripture in a way we hadn’t in years. Over time, our family altar became a place not just of prayer, but of healing and growth. It became a refuge where we could bring our burdens before God and trust Him to work in the challenges we were facing. It was a space where we could laugh together, cry together, and encourage one another.”",

A lot of believers today are missing God’s provision for their lives and marriage because they are not led by the Spirit. Your provision in life is where God leads to. There are countless examples of this in the scripture. Lot looked at the plains of Jordan and it was so green that it looked like the garden of the Lord (Gen 13:10). Lot decided to choose with his senses like most believers do. At the end of the Day, the destruction of Sodom caught up with him. The fact that it’s green doesn't mean it's God.",

He allowed the economic situation of the land to lead him out of God's land to a place that was booming economically. In today’s parlance, he “Japa” with his family without being led by God. At the end of the day, his lineage was wiped out of history by death. Provision and prosperity are in the place that God leads you to. If God leads you into the wilderness, it will become a city. If God leads you into a desert, it will overflow with rivers. Don’t just move because things are hard, be led because your destiny is location-sensitive. A fish is designed to live in water. An elephant is made for the jungle. There’s a place God has positioned you and that’s where your provision lies.",

And there, the Lord sent provision of food to him daily. God led again to a widow in Zarephath who will make provision for his needs again. Elijah was feeding fat while others were dying in famine because he was led by God. God knows where your provisions lie and if you allow him to lead, you will never lack. David says “The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want” As long as God is leading you, your green pasture is guaranteed. Trust his voice to lead you to your promised land.

Most believers can’t figure out God’s will due to their immaturity in Christ. Remaining a babe in Christ makes your spiritual senses underdeveloped. Don't be deceived, being born again does not release to you all that you are in Christ. It gives you access but you must develop some spiritual stamina to be able to take them.",

That lady might be beautiful but is she the will of God for you? The job might have great pay but is it the will of God for you? A mature believer knows that because it is good doesn't mean that God is in it. Whatever is not part of God’s will for you is a waste of your time and much more, it is disobedience",

Praying in tongues always gives you a strange insight into life. It impacts the spirit of wisdom and understanding in your life. You are always in touch with God directly when you engage in praying in tongues. When you pray in tongues, you pray according to the will of God. So you can never pray amiss.

            "My father in the Lord shared a story with me recently. One day, he called his younger brother who lives in another town to come see him. Immediately he left and travelled down to the city where he resides. While coming, all that was on his mind was that he was coming to do a job for a client he was going to recommend to him. When he got to him, he gave him a key and pointed to a car covered with a covering. He didn’t understand, so he removed the cover and beheld a Mercedes Benz car. He told him the car is yours, this is the reason I called you to come. He stood by the car for some minutes and tears rolled down his cheeks and he stared unbelievably at his new car.",

          textTwo:
            "You see, this is the same experience we have in Christ. Sometimes, we don’t understand the purpose of the call of God for our lives. And we jettison and make light of this call because we do not understand why He is calling us. Sometimes, the hope we have in mind is the wrong one. But I want you to know that there is hope for His call in your life. And I can assure you that that hope is far greater than what you are thinking. This is why you must discover the hope of his calling in your life. This will help you to answer swiftly and appropriately. A lot of people are distracted by what the Lord is calling them from because their eyes are blinded to what the Lord is calling them into.",

          textThree:
            "God is calling you into the glorious riches of His power. He is calling you into unprecedented glory and wealth such as you have never seen. He is calling you to be co-heirs with Christ. The hope of His calling is for you to sit with Him on the throne of Dominion far above all powers and principalities. He is calling you into the endless life of God. He is calling you into the greatest and highest reign. He never calls into poverty, lack, slavery, or mediocrity. Your eyes must be enlightened by the word of God so that you may know the hope of His calling for your life. But if He is calling, answer today by faith because you will never regret it.",

        bibleVerse: "Romans 8:1",

        memoryVerse:
          "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.",

        studyBible: "1 JOHN 3:19-23",

        texts: {
          textOne:
            "Most believers today are under the burden of self-condemnation and this is impeding their walk with God. Some parents condemn themselves for the death or failure of their children. Some condemn themselves for the suicide of their friends. Fathers, condemn themselves for the mistakes of their sons. Pastors condemn themselves for the bad marriage of their members. The first common reason for self-condemnation is confidence in the flesh. You were too sure you couldn't make that mistake, so when you made it, you were so hard on yourself. You were so confident you couldn’t fall into that sin, and when you did eventually, you couldn't forgive yourself. Confidence in yourself will always lead to self-condemnation.",

          textTwo:
            "Second, the ignorance of many believers. God doesn’t expect you to be perfect on your own. That is why He made provision for you through Christ Jesus and the indwelling of the Holy Ghost. Through the embrace of what Jesus did, you can stand before God blameless. Even when you fall, God isn’t mad at you. If He was not mad at you before you knew Him, how much more after you know Him? Stop allowing your heart to condemn you. Immediately embrace the love and forgiveness of your Father. God does not hate sin because He can't stand it but because of what it does to you. It alienates you from Him. But God loves you, and Christ already paid the price for sin.",

          textThree:
            "The longer we accept condemnation in our hearts, the easier we slip into sin, frustration, depression, isolation, and eventually death. There is no justification for self-condemnation. Condemning yourself does not take the error or mistake away nor does it make you feel any better. If Jesus who died for you did not condemn you, who are you to condemn yourself? You have no right to condemn yourself because Christ already justified you. All you need to do is to accept that justification and be conscious of who you are in Christ. Even when you take the wrong step, immediately rise and change your direction. You are already justified!",
