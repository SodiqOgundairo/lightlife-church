            "Dear Family, HAPPY NEW YEAR! I want to officially welcome you to the year 2025. What a blessing to be part of the people that overcame 2023 and its dangers. Despite all the evil in the previous year, none of them is powerful enough to stop you from seeing the new year. I want you to know that it is a privilege supplied through the grace of God for you to be part of the people celebrating the new year. As we turn the page to this fresh chapter, we find ourselves filled with new hopes, opportunities, and possibilities. A new year is a moment to reflect on where we've been and to set our hearts toward where we want to go. It’s a time to realign ourselves with God's calling and seek His guidance for the road ahead.This year, I want to encourage you to focus on five powerful pillars that will not only shape your personal journey but also deepen your walk with God: Focus, Resilience, Diligence, Purity, and Prayer.",

Yet, one of the most powerful things we can do in 2025 is choose to focus on what truly matters: our relationship with God, our family, our calling, and our personal growth (Hebrews 12:2,). Let this focus guide your decisions, your actions, and your heart.Resilience is the ability to bounce back after facing trials, setbacks, and hardships. The year ahead will likely bring both joy and struggles, but what matters most is how we respond. Life will test us, but it is in those moments that God builds our resilience, our strength to endure and rise above. (Romans 5:3-4) ",

Diligence is about committing to the process, working hard with integrity, and giving your best, even when the results aren't immediately visible. It’s not about working harder but about working smarter, with a heart that is fully invested in God's calling for your life. (Proverbs 12:24) ",

          textFour:
            "Purity is about living with integrity and guarding our hearts and minds from the influences that seek to pull us away from God. In a world full of distractions, temptations, and confusion, maintaining purity requires intentionality and surrenderness to God’s will (Psalm 119:9). Living with purity is not just about avoiding sin; it's about filling our hearts with what is good, pure, and holy. ",

          textFive:
            "Lastly, prayer is the cornerstone of our relationship with God. Prayer keeps us aligned with His will, strengthens us in our weaknesses, and invites His power into every area of our lives. In 2025, let prayer be your daily rhythm, your breath, and your foundation. (Philippians 4:6-7). Prayer isn’t just about asking; it’s about listening, connecting, and aligning our hearts with God’s purposes.",

But I realized that the act of gathering together in God's presence was far more important than perfection. So, I shared the idea with my husband. To my surprise, he was on board. We decided to start small: five minutes of Bible reading and prayer each evening. We weren’t looking for some grand spiritual awakening, just a commitment to prioritize God together.",

My husband and I found ourselves bonding over Scripture in a way we hadn’t in years. Over time, our family altar became a place not just of prayer, but of healing and growth. It became a refuge where we could bring our burdens before God and trust Him to work in the challenges we were facing.

A lot of believers today are missing God’s provision for their lives and marriage because they are not led by the Spirit. Your provision in life is where God leads to. There are countless examples of this in the scripture. Lot looked at the plains of Jordan and it was so green that it looked like the garden of the Lord (Gen 13:10). Lot decided to choose with his senses like most believers do. At the end of the Day, the destruction of Sodom caught up with him. The fact that it’s green doesn't mean it's God.",

He allowed the economic situation of the land to lead him out of God's land to a place that was booming economically. In today’s parlance, he “Japa” with his family without being led by God. At the end of the day, his lineage was wiped out of history by death. Provision and prosperity are in the place that God leads you to. If God leads you into the wilderness, it will become a city. If God leads you into a desert, it will overflow with rivers. Don’t just move because things are hard, be led because your destiny is location-sensitive. A fish is designed to live in water. An elephant is made for the jungle. There’s a place God has positioned you and that’s where your provision lies.",

And there, the Lord sent provision of food to him daily. God led again to a widow in Zarephath who will make provision for his needs again. Elijah was feeding fat while others were dying in famine because he was led by God. God knows where your provisions lie and if you allow him to lead, you will never lack. David says “The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want” As long as God is leading you, your green pasture is guaranteed. Trust his voice to lead you to your promised land.

God is not only interested in your spiritual life alone, there is God’s will for your marriage, education, career, business, choice of friends, where you live, and all other areas of your life. You cannot live a fulfilling life if you don’t understand His will for you. There is no way you can obey God when you can't simply discern what His will for you is. This is why many believers today just do guesswork. They keep trying one thing to another, guessing what they think God will want them to do. God doesn't want us to guess or assume as regards His will. He wants us to be sure.",

          textTwo:
            "Not knowing the will of God does not only displease Him but also wastes your time, resources, and energy. However, God did not leave us without clearly stating what His will is for every area of our lives. Don’t do guesswork when His will for you is plainly written in His word. Most believers can’t figure out God’s will due to their immaturity in Christ. Remaining a babe in Christ makes your spiritual senses underdeveloped. Don't be deceived, being born again does not release to you all that you are in Christ. It gives you access but you must develop some spiritual stamina to be able to take them.",

            "Our memory verse affirmed that it is foolish not to know the will of God for your life. Understanding His will simply means knowing his plan and purpose for your life. Understanding what He wants for you and what He doesn't. There are things you might think are good for you but are not part of His will for you. That lady might be beautiful but is she the will of God for you? The job might have great pay but is it the will of God for you? A mature believer knows that because it is good doesn't mean that God is in it. Whatever is not part of God’s will for you is a waste of your time and much more, it is disobedience",

You are always in touch with God directly when you engage in praying in tongues. When you pray in tongues, you pray according to the will of God. So you can never pray amiss.

The first common reason for self-condemnation is confidence in the flesh. You were too sure you couldn't make that mistake, so when you made it, you were so hard on yourself.

Even when you fall, God isn’t mad at you. If He was not mad at you before you knew Him, how much more after you know Him? Stop allowing your heart to condemn you. Immediately embrace the love and forgiveness of your Father. God does not hate sin because He can't stand it but because of what it does to you. It alienates you from Him.

Serving others often requires sacrifice, whether it's time, energy, or resources, and it challenges you to die to yourself in a way that brings us closer to the image of Christ.

This is why our relationship with God is not going on smoothly. God wants us to relate with Him according to our understanding of His love, not fear. There is an expression of fear (reverence) in love but what we know is being afraid.

The love of God is not something you can buy or do something to qualify for.You cannot bribe God to love you.

            "One of the unpopular components of spiritual growth is trials. One of the reasons we have weak Christianity today is because we have a “have it easy mentality.” This generation of Christians believes that once you are a Christian, trials and tribulations are not supposed to come to you. This generation of believers often runs away from trials. They want to serve God without making any sacrifices or commitments. They want a celebrity pastor who will demand no commitment from them. They want to worship in the closest, finest, and most comfortable church in town. They criticize giving, tithing, and anything that pushes them away from their comfort zones.",

          textTwo:
            "However, this was not the same gospel handed down to us. This was not the gospel that Paul or any of the disciples practiced. Trials are part of the menu for your spiritual growth. You don’t need to pray for trials, they have a way of finding you. But when they come, James said you should count it all joy. Another translation says you should see it as a gift. Trial is a gift because it helps you to mature in Christ. Pleasure will never teach you half of what trials will teach you. On the other side of challenges is a better you.",

          textThree:
            "Trials reveal your spiritual maturity. Challenges and trials come to everyone. What differentiates a baby Christian from a mature believer is how they respond to trials.  A baby Christian will cry and wail when trials come. Consequently, he becomes a victim. But a growing Christian rejoices because he knows all things work together for his good. He takes up the challenges, does all that's required, and comes out as an overcomer. Sometimes we are too lazy to pray, fast, give, and serve until we are in one challenge where the only way out is these things. Trials will force you to grow. Some people never exercise their faith until they have a health crisis. Some never fast until they experience a delay. Some are never loving until their marriage hits a rock. Trials help you to change. The grace of God is not meant to keep suffering away but meant to empower you in it.",

A lot of young folks out there believe that as long as they are born again, they do not need to belong to any local church, submit to a spiritual head, or serve under a ministry.

If all you do is the online church and you do not participate in any system of the church, your growth will be very limited. Serving God as a believer is what helps your spiritual growth. Most times, what makes many believers run away from serving in their local church is pride. If you are too proud to serve, you are too small to lead. Don’t be too proud to do the little things in the church. Some are so full of Rhema that once their pastor does not give them a role on the pulpit, they are too big to serve in other systems like sanitation, welfare, media, or any places where they can’t be seen.",

            "Activities may not necessarily lead to spiritual growth but you cannot grow without activities. Your light cannot shine without serving others, especially believers. Isolating yourself from others is not spiritual maturity, it is spiritual pride. Some will say they do not want any trouble from church people, well this is also a sign of carnality. Labouring in the vine is part of serving and working with others. Though we are sons, we are also servants of God. Paul noted that one of the signs of spiritual maturity is serving as a teacher in the church. To grow, commit yourself to serve in a local church. Submit to a spiritual head to whom you are accountable. Find a department in the church to work with. Use your gifts and skills for the furtherance of the church. As you do this, you will grow in love and Christ. Your online church must not replace a local church.",

Never forget how God provided or healed you because that is what will boost your faith in times of lack and sickness. Keep a good memory of God’s intervention in your life.

I have seen many believers who were very fervent just before their visitation and breakthrough came. Immediately God blessed them, they disappeared from the church. These are forgetters.

Don’t allow what you think God didn’t do make you forget all He has done. Saul forgot how much being chosen as a king meant to him.

But the moment they receive their answered prayer, they suddenly forget everything. This is why you must document your encounters and testimonies. Write them down in your note, on the wall of your house, and name something after it. And you must go back often to read them so that you can trigger that emotion afresh.

It often begins with a simple thought: “I can do this on my own.” It starts small, perhaps as self-confidence or independence, but left unchecked, it grows and distorts our relationship with God and with others. Scripture makes it clear that pride is not only dangerous but also destructive. The Bible frequently warns against the prideful heart and reminds us that humility is the way to true exaltation in God’s Kingdom.",

The danger of this attitude is that it leads us to rely on our own strength, wisdom, and achievements rather than trusting in the Lord. When we humble ourselves before God, acknowledging that we are nothing without Him, we invite His presence and blessing into our lives. But when we cling to pride, we shut God out, pushing Him away in favor of our own self-sufficiency. God’s desire is not to humiliate us but to lift us up. He longs to bless and empower us, but He can only do that when we acknowledge His sovereignty and submit to His will. (1 Peter 5:6).",

We become competitive, judgmental, and dismissive of those we consider “beneath” us. Pride leads to an inflated sense of self-importance and an inability to show love, grace, and humility to others. In contrast, humility fosters unity, love, and understanding. The apostle Paul, in Philippians 2:3-4, urges believers to “do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others.” Humility allows us to put others first, to listen without judgment, and to serve with a pure heart.

Pride prevents you from asking for help, whether from God or from fellow believers. It makes us reluctant to confess our sins and seek God’s forgiveness.

Satan’s pride led to his eternal separation from God, and he became the adversary of God and His people.

Humility begins when we acknowledge our dependence on God and our need for His grace. James 4:10 encourages us: “Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.” When we humble ourselves before God, we open ourselves to His favor and grace. God exalts the humble, while the proud will eventually be humbled. Humility allows us to grow in grace, to reflect God’s character, and to experience the abundant life He has promised.",

It’s about leaning on God’s promises and remembering that He has provided a way to escape.",

Without self-control, we are vulnerable to all kinds of destruction—whether it’s damaged relationships, poor health, or compromised integrity. But when we practice self-control, we build up walls of protection in our lives. We gain the ability to stay steady in challenging situations, make wise decisions, and avoid the consequences of impulsive behavior. ",

This is because when God looks at you, He isn't looking for your fault, He is looking at Christ in you. If He is looking for your fault, He will definitely find some (Ps 130:3). This is why God doesn't condemn. What about when I sin as a believer? Well, God still does not condemn. He simply forgives you. So, why do I feel bad and condemned when I sin?

So, are you saying it is okay not to feel bad and guilty when we sin? My answer is, does feeling bad and guilty about your sins take them away? You see, when you sin, and you are disappointed in yourself, sometimes, you curse yourself, some even go to the extent of hurting themselves. You do this because you have put confidence in your flesh initially. Don’t hide when you sin. That was the mistake of Adam. Just come confidently to the throne of grace and obtain mercy for forgiveness and grace for empowerment. The condemnation of your heart most times does not lead to repentance.

He must be of noble birth, well-read (probably a Ph.D. holder), must be associated with the high and mighty, and have many high-profile qualities. However, when God was about to choose a king in Israel, He went to the backside of the bush and picked a nobody.

There are times when you are spreading and acquiring some things and it looks like growth. But not every growth is a healthy growth. Cancer, lumps, and other forms of diseases are unhealthy growths in the body that were not pruned early. So God will cut some things off your life. It might be some material things that God will ask you to give away so that you can grow. But if you don’t understand, you will think God is punishing you. When you bear fruits, you must be pruned.",

When you remain in the vine and allow his pruning you bear much more fruit. Allow Christ pruning so that you don’t begin to have cancerous growth.

There are some texts in the bible that their understanding is not on the surface. Many times, we read the bible with an absent mind. When you come to study the bible, put your thinking cap on. Be ready to engage your mind in the study. Use the same intensity you would use to study your anatomy text if you were a doctor to study the Bible, the same way you study your charts if you were a trader.",

The Bible, however, gives you a fresh understanding every time you read the same passage. You can read it one thousand times and it’s still fresh. Read the Bible over and over again. Sometimes, I try to read an entire book at a time. However, don't get familiar with reading a text repeatedly. Approach the same text with a fresh hunger and expectation to get something new from it.",

The best voice to hear the bible read is your voice. Remember, faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of God. Also, you can have a bible reading date with a friend to whom you read some portions of the bible loudly to one another. Lastly, you can write out and paste some bible verses on your walls and walkways. Seeing these scriptures every day will minister to you daily.",

Prayer and studying the Bible are not two separate activities. They actually go together. To study effectively, it must go with prayer. To pray effectively, you must pray scripturally. To study effectively, pray before you start studying and pray as you study. Studying the bible is not just an intellectual chore, it's a spiritual venture. Pray that the Lord will open your eyes and give you understanding of what you are reading. The Ethiopian Eunuch was reading the bible yet he couldn’t understand it.

To engage your imagination, you can read the bible in different translations like the Amplified version, NLT, RSV, ASV, and some other recent translations. Create pictures and images in your head while you read the bible. Many believers see the Bible more like fiction than an actual history of real events. Everything in the Bible happened in real life. Your imagination will help you see and relate to it as a real-life event.",

Ruminate on the text you read. Lastly, read purposefully. Find a purpose for studying the scripture and this will keep you committed to it. Why do you want to study a text in the Bible?

Many believers do not prosper today despite their belief in God. But please note that your prosperity lies in the honour you give to the anointed. I recently visited one of our first-timers in her restaurant. She was so excited to see me. She received me well and gave me gifts when I was leaving.

If your son is a prophet and all you see is your son, his anointing will never work for you. If the pastor is your childhood friend and all you see is your friend, you can't draw from his grace.

The enemy knows that as long as you dishonor your anointed, his anointing can never work for you. If you want to receive what God has sent your pastor to give you, you must close your hearts to his errors and focus on honouring him. Honouring your Man of God is your legal obligation, not a choice. It is the key to your prosperity. It is your access to receiving the grace that he carries.

Like some of us, we don’t pretend and we do not delight in you seeing us as special or different. When this happens, naturally your honour for him might decline.

As a person, one of the ways you honour your man of God is by blessing him financially and materially (Gal 6:6, 1Cor 9:11). Separate some amount of money to bless your anointed.

This daily surrender through prayers allows us to experience God's presence in every moment. Every battle presents an opportunity to exercise faith. It’s not always about achieving the “big wins” we envision, but trusting that God’s plan for us is unfolding. By focusing on His promises and His faithfulness, we win the spiritual battle against doubt, fear, and discouragement. Faith is the victory that overcomes the world (1 John 5:4).",

Gratitude shifts our perspective and helps us see the blessings in even the hardest moments. Every choice we make in obedience to God is a victory. It’s not always easy, but each step of faith brings us closer to God’s best for our lives. Even when the outcome isn’t immediate, the process of obeying God’s Word and walking in His ways leads us to ultimate victory in Him.",

            "One of the greatest gifts God has given us is the blessing of relationships. Whether it's our marriage, family, friendships, or our connection with the church community, these relationships shape our lives and can be a source of joy, growth, and support. I believe that the greatest investment of God is not in land, it's in humans. However, sustaining godly relationships takes effort. It's not always easy, but it’s worth it. The Bible offers timeless wisdom on how we can nurture relationships that reflect God’s love, grace, and truth. But the process isn’t passive, it's an intentional, daily choice.",

            "I’ll be honest, when I first got married, I thought our love would carry us through every challenge. But soon, I discovered that love is not just a feeling; it’s a choice. And choosing love in the midst of disagreements, stress, or hurt can be difficult. There was one season in our marriage, early on, when my wife and I struggled with communication. Small misunderstandings turned into arguments. We were so caught up in the whirlwind of life that we had no time to listen to each other, let alone understand one another’s needs.",

            "That’s when I remembered the verse from Ephesians 4:2: “Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love.” (NIV). That night, I prayed, asking God to help me approach my wife with patience and humility, to choose love even when I was frustrated. The foundation of any godly relationship is love. In 1 Corinthians 13, we are reminded of what love looks like. True love is selfless, patient, and forgiving. Whether it’s a spouse, a family member, or a friend, love means giving them the grace to fail, the space to grow, and the patience to see them through tough times.",

          textFour:
            "Patience is key in every relationship. People, including ourselves, make mistakes. We fail, we falter, and we sometimes get on each other’s nerves. But God calls us to be patient with one another, just as He is patient with us (In Romans 15:5). Forgiveness is also essential in sustaining godly relationships. It’s easy to hold onto offenses, but unforgiveness only builds walls between us and others. In my own life, I’ve learned that when I choose to forgive—whether in marriage, friendships, or family—I’m not excusing the wrong, but I’m choosing to release the burden of bitterness (Colossians 3:13)",

Continue to speak the word until you begin to see it work in your body. Third, by laying of hands, praying, and anointing. (James 5:14). You don’t need to bear your sickness any longer.

It is an abuse of grace to remain in the things, life, and environment that God saved you from. (Romans 6:1-2 What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer?). Many believers have been saved for years, yet they have nothing to do in their local church. This has nothing to do with full-time ministry. All believers should be able to preach to others and teach others the scripture. You don’t have to be an apostle to be able to teach.

Some resort to hurting themselves, and in critical cases, suicide is possible. The worst of all these causes is hopelessness. Don’t ever get to a point where you lose hope. Once hope is lost, everything is lost. A man without hope has no reason to live. This is why depression can lead to suicide. When depression sets in, there is a voice that speaks to you. A voice that tells you that you are useless. Nobody cares about you, and all sorts of evil things. This is why it must be tackled not just clinically, but spiritually. ",

As you get closer to your pastor, you see him go to the toilet, see him cry, eat, play, and do things that ordinary humans do. That’s because he is human too. Like some of us, we don’t pretend and we do not delight in you seeing us as special or different. When this happens, naturally your honour for him might decline. This is why it is dangerous to be close to an anointed person. The fact that a man or woman is anointed does not make him less human. Therefore, you must create a system that ensures that your honour for him increases.",

            "I can say that the person that honours me most as an anointed person is my wife. Yet no one knows my weaknesses, errors, mistakes or is closer to me than her. Before anyone started giving me an honorarium, my wife will bless me with her money after a powerful sermon and say “I must sow into this anointing”. She still does it till now. As a person, one of the ways you honour your man of God is by blessing him financially and materially (Gal 6:6, 1Cor 9:11). Separate some amount of money to bless your anointed. It can be monthly, weekly or yearly. This must be something that costs you something, not just anything. This is a system of honour.",

Also, speak well of your Pastor everywhere you go. Don’t just stand where people abuse your pastor or any pastor, and you are mute. Defend your pastor in times of persecution and stand with them in hard times. This is how you can receive from his anointing. Support the vision of your Pastor even when you don’t understand it. Share his messages with your friends, invite people to his meetings, buy his materials, and be proud of him.",

The fact that some preachers abuse this principle does not mean God has forsaken it. This is one of the very expressions of God's Nature.

It is right for those who serve on the altar to partake of the offering of the altar. We are enjoined to also give to the poor in our society.

If we are not condemned, then we must not condemn others. The only person with the ministry of condemnation is Satan. In Christ you are justified, you are set free from all charges and you have been found guiltless. You can’t be punished for those sins again.
