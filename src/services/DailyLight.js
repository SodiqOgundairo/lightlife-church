Some see it just as a religious manual. Some see it as a mysterious book that cannot be understood. The greatest way the devil fights us is by influencing how we get to see the bible. ",

Many think the scripture is about Christ, it is correct but not very correct. The scripture is about you. Jesus doesn’t need the word to function, but you do.

My answer is, does feeling bad and guilty about your sins take it away? You see, when you sin, and you are disappointed in yourself, sometimes, you curse yourself, some even go to the extent of hurting themselves. You do this because you have put confidence in your flesh initially. Don’t hide when you sin. That was the mistake of Adam. Just come confidently to the throne of grace and obtain mercy for forgiveness and grace for empowerment. The condemnation of your heart most times does not lead to repentance. It makes you run away from God. When you have trained yourself not to condemn you, that’s when you have confidence in the righteousness of God.",

A lot of young folks out there believe that as long as they are born again they do not need to belong to any local church, submit to a spiritual head, or serve under a ministry.

If all you do is the online church and you do not participate in any system of the church, your growth will be very limited. Serving God as a believer is what helps your spiritual growth. Most times, what makes many believers run away from serving in their local church is pride. If you are too proud to serve, you are too small to lead. Don’t be too proud to do the little things in the church. Some are so full of rhema that once their pastor does not give them a role on the pulpit, they are too big to serve in other systems like sanitation, welfare, media, or any places where they can’t be seen.",

Labouring in the vine is part of serving and working with others.  Though we are sons, we are also servants of God. Paul noted that one of the signs of spiritual maturity is serving as a teacher in the church. To grow, commit yourself to serve in a local church. Submit to a spiritual head to whom you are accountable. Find a department in the church to work with. Use your gifts and skills for the furtherance of the church.

Many believers do not prosper today despite their belief in God. But please note that your prosperity lies in the honour you give to the anointed. I recently visited one of our first-timers in her restaurant. She was so excited to see me. She received me well and gave me gifts when I was leaving.

Second, always come to the office before your boss or anyone for that matter. Be the first to be at meetings, and don't always give excuses for late coming.

Sixth, bless your boss with a gift from your salary once in a while. After your salary is sent to you, send your boss a recharge card and thank them. I know it’s your salary and you worked for it, but I'm showing you how to stand out and get favour in difficult times. Lastly, be real. Do all these things from your heart. Don’t do eye service.

Even the ones you commit in your heart are known to God. This is why James encouraged us to confess our sins to one another. Sometimes, confession is all you need to break the power of that sin.",

There is God’s will concerning all areas of your life.

You cannot live a fulfilling life if you don’t understand His will for you. There is no way you can obey God when you can't simply discern what His will for you is.

We will be focusing on the first one in this devotional for the next few days. Believers today understand the fear of God more than they understand the love of God. This is why our relationship with God is not going on smoothly. God wants us to relate with Him according to our understanding of His love, not fear. There is an expression of fear (reverence) in love but what we know is being afraid. The Old Testament pattern of relating with God was based on how much you feared (afraid) God but in the New Testament, we were introduced to the love of God (John 14:15)",

There is nothing you can do that can make God hate you. It will only be possible for God to hate you if it is possible for Him to hate Jesus. The same way the Father loves Jesus is also the same way the Father loves you. So, if it’s impossible for the Father to hate Jesus, then it is impossible for the Father to hate you.

The love of God is not something you can buy or do something to qualify for. You cannot bribe God to love you. In fact, He loved you while you were still a sinner, while you were still being rebellious against Him, while you were still living in disobedience. While you still hate Him and don’t know that you need him. God loves you.

It is in the New Testament that we can walk in the fullness of God’s love and power. If we must understand the love of God in the New Covenant, then we must also understand the fatherhood of God. Unlike our earthly fathers, the best they can give to their children is their inheritance.

Therefore, this gives us the ability to act in the place of God, it gives us the potential to do the things that God can do. God shared everything He has and He is with us. This is amazing.

You are not God’s slave, you are His child. Your place is not at His feet, you are seated with Him on the throne. What a privilege. This is why the greatest revelation of God in the New Testament is God as our Father. Jesus referred to God as His father and He wants us to also relate to Him as children of God and not slaves.

You do this because you have put confidence in your flesh initially. Don’t hide when you sin. That was the mistake of Adam.

Many believers just see the bible as one ancient script, written originally with some weird language that’s out of fashion. Some see it just as a religious manual.

You will malfunction when your bible is closed. It is the word of God. It’s written for you and about you. Without it, you can’t find yourself. Many think the scripture is about Christ, it is correct but not very correct. The scripture is about you. Jesus doesn’t need the word to function, but you do. Your source, your power, your assignment, your mission, your gifts, your blueprint, your solutions, and your destination are all scripted in the bible.

The first way to go about this is to read the Bible thoughtfully. There are some texts in the bible that their understanding is not on the surface. Many times, we read the bible with an absent mind. When you come to study the bible, put your thinking cap on. Be ready to engage your mind in the study. Use the same intensity you would use to study your anatomy text if you were a doctor to study the Bible, the same way you study your charts if you were a trader.",

You can read it one thousand times and it’s still fresh. Read the Bible over and over again. Sometimes, I try to read an entire book at a time. However, don't get familiar with reading a text repeatedly. Approach the same text with a fresh hunger and expectation to get something new from it.",

Similarly, read the scripture aloud. The best voice to hear the bible read is your voice. Remember, faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of God. Also, you can have a bible reading date with a friend to whom you read some portions of the bible loudly to one another. Lastly, you can write out and paste some bible verses on your walls and walkways. Seeing these scriptures every day will minister to you daily.",

Prayer and studying the Bible are not two separate activities. They actually go together. To study effectively, it must go with prayer. To pray effectively, you must pray scripturally. To study effectively, pray before you start studying and pray as you study. Studying the bible is not just an intellectual chore, it's a spiritual venture. Pray that the Lord will open your eyes and give you understanding of what you are reading. The Ethiopian Eunuch was reading the bible yet he couldn’t understand it. This is why the Spirit must open your mind to see the treasures there.",

To engage your imagination, you can read the bible in different translations like the Amplified version, NLT, RSV, ASV, and some other recent translations. Create pictures and images in your head while you read the bible. Many believers see the Bible more like fiction than an actual history of real events. Everything in the Bible happened in real life.

Ignorantly, we only start preparing and praying for marriage when we are six months away from the wedding. What a mistake. Most times, we already lost the battle before we even started and that is why domestic violence, separation, and divorce is on the increase in our society.
