            "Dear Family, HAPPY NEW YEAR! I want to officially welcome you to the year 2025. What a blessing to be part of the people that overcame 2023 and its dangers. Despite all the evil in the previous year, none of them is powerful enough to stop you from seeing the new year. I want you to know that it is a privilege supplied through the grace of God for you to be part of the people celebrating the new year. As we turn the page to this fresh chapter, we find ourselves filled with new hopes, opportunities, and possibilities. A new year is a moment to reflect on where we've been and to set our hearts toward where we want to go. It’s a time to realign ourselves with God's calling and seek His guidance for the road ahead.This year, I want to encourage you to focus on five powerful pillars that will not only shape your personal journey but also deepen your walk with God: Focus, Resilience, Diligence, Purity, and Prayer.",

Yet, one of the most powerful things we can do in 2025 is choose to focus on what truly matters: our relationship with God, our family, our calling, and our personal growth (Hebrews 12:2,). Let this focus guide your decisions, your actions, and your heart.Resilience is the ability to bounce back after facing trials, setbacks, and hardships. The year ahead will likely bring both joy and struggles, but what matters most is how we respond. Life will test us, but it is in those moments that God builds our resilience, our strength to endure and rise above. (Romans 5:3-4) ",

Diligence is about committing to the process, working hard with integrity, and giving your best, even when the results aren't immediately visible. It’s not about working harder but about working smarter, with a heart that is fully invested in God's calling for your life. (Proverbs 12:24) ",

          textFour:
            "Purity is about living with integrity and guarding our hearts and minds from the influences that seek to pull us away from God. In a world full of distractions, temptations, and confusion, maintaining purity requires intentionality and surrenderness to God’s will (Psalm 119:9). Living with purity is not just about avoiding sin; it's about filling our hearts with what is good, pure, and holy. ",

          textFive:
            "Lastly, prayer is the cornerstone of our relationship with God. Prayer keeps us aligned with His will, strengthens us in our weaknesses, and invites His power into every area of our lives. In 2025, let prayer be your daily rhythm, your breath, and your foundation. (Philippians 4:6-7). Prayer isn’t just about asking; it’s about listening, connecting, and aligning our hearts with God’s purposes.",

But I realized that the act of gathering together in God's presence was far more important than perfection. So, I shared the idea with my husband. To my surprise, he was on board. We decided to start small: five minutes of Bible reading and prayer each evening. We weren’t looking for some grand spiritual awakening, just a commitment to prioritize God together.",

My husband and I found ourselves bonding over Scripture in a way we hadn’t in years. Over time, our family altar became a place not just of prayer, but of healing and growth. It became a refuge where we could bring our burdens before God and trust Him to work in the challenges we were facing.

A lot of believers today are missing God’s provision for their lives and marriage because they are not led by the Spirit. Your provision in life is where God leads to. There are countless examples of this in the scripture. Lot looked at the plains of Jordan and it was so green that it looked like the garden of the Lord (Gen 13:10). Lot decided to choose with his senses like most believers do. At the end of the Day, the destruction of Sodom caught up with him. The fact that it’s green doesn't mean it's God.",

He allowed the economic situation of the land to lead him out of God's land to a place that was booming economically. In today’s parlance, he “Japa” with his family without being led by God. At the end of the day, his lineage was wiped out of history by death. Provision and prosperity are in the place that God leads you to. If God leads you into the wilderness, it will become a city. If God leads you into a desert, it will overflow with rivers. Don’t just move because things are hard, be led because your destiny is location-sensitive. A fish is designed to live in water. An elephant is made for the jungle. There’s a place God has positioned you and that’s where your provision lies.",

And there, the Lord sent provision of food to him daily. God led again to a widow in Zarephath who will make provision for his needs again. Elijah was feeding fat while others were dying in famine because he was led by God. God knows where your provisions lie and if you allow him to lead, you will never lack. David says “The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want” As long as God is leading you, your green pasture is guaranteed. Trust his voice to lead you to your promised land.

God is not only interested in your spiritual life alone, there is God’s will for your marriage, education, career, business, choice of friends, where you live, and all other areas of your life. You cannot live a fulfilling life if you don’t understand His will for you. There is no way you can obey God when you can't simply discern what His will for you is. This is why many believers today just do guesswork. They keep trying one thing to another, guessing what they think God will want them to do. God doesn't want us to guess or assume as regards His will. He wants us to be sure.",

          textTwo:
            "Not knowing the will of God does not only displease Him but also wastes your time, resources, and energy. However, God did not leave us without clearly stating what His will is for every area of our lives. Don’t do guesswork when His will for you is plainly written in His word. Most believers can’t figure out God’s will due to their immaturity in Christ. Remaining a babe in Christ makes your spiritual senses underdeveloped. Don't be deceived, being born again does not release to you all that you are in Christ. It gives you access but you must develop some spiritual stamina to be able to take them.",

            "Our memory verse affirmed that it is foolish not to know the will of God for your life. Understanding His will simply means knowing his plan and purpose for your life. Understanding what He wants for you and what He doesn't. There are things you might think are good for you but are not part of His will for you. That lady might be beautiful but is she the will of God for you? The job might have great pay but is it the will of God for you? A mature believer knows that because it is good doesn't mean that God is in it. Whatever is not part of God’s will for you is a waste of your time and much more, it is disobedience",

You are always in touch with God directly when you engage in praying in tongues. When you pray in tongues, you pray according to the will of God. So you can never pray amiss.

The first common reason for self-condemnation is confidence in the flesh. You were too sure you couldn't make that mistake, so when you made it, you were so hard on yourself.

Even when you fall, God isn’t mad at you. If He was not mad at you before you knew Him, how much more after you know Him? Stop allowing your heart to condemn you. Immediately embrace the love and forgiveness of your Father. God does not hate sin because He can't stand it but because of what it does to you. It alienates you from Him.

Serving others often requires sacrifice, whether it's time, energy, or resources, and it challenges you to die to yourself in a way that brings us closer to the image of Christ.

This is why our relationship with God is not going on smoothly. God wants us to relate with Him according to our understanding of His love, not fear. There is an expression of fear (reverence) in love but what we know is being afraid.

The love of God is not something you can buy or do something to qualify for.You cannot bribe God to love you.

            "One of the unpopular components of spiritual growth is trials. One of the reasons we have weak Christianity today is because we have a “have it easy mentality.” This generation of Christians believes that once you are a Christian, trials and tribulations are not supposed to come to you. This generation of believers often runs away from trials. They want to serve God without making any sacrifices or commitments. They want a celebrity pastor who will demand no commitment from them. They want to worship in the closest, finest, and most comfortable church in town. They criticize giving, tithing, and anything that pushes them away from their comfort zones.",

          textTwo:
            "However, this was not the same gospel handed down to us. This was not the gospel that Paul or any of the disciples practiced. Trials are part of the menu for your spiritual growth. You don’t need to pray for trials, they have a way of finding you. But when they come, James said you should count it all joy. Another translation says you should see it as a gift. Trial is a gift because it helps you to mature in Christ. Pleasure will never teach you half of what trials will teach you. On the other side of challenges is a better you.",

          textThree:
            "Trials reveal your spiritual maturity. Challenges and trials come to everyone. What differentiates a baby Christian from a mature believer is how they respond to trials.  A baby Christian will cry and wail when trials come. Consequently, he becomes a victim. But a growing Christian rejoices because he knows all things work together for his good. He takes up the challenges, does all that's required, and comes out as an overcomer. Sometimes we are too lazy to pray, fast, give, and serve until we are in one challenge where the only way out is these things. Trials will force you to grow. Some people never exercise their faith until they have a health crisis. Some never fast until they experience a delay. Some are never loving until their marriage hits a rock. Trials help you to change. The grace of God is not meant to keep suffering away but meant to empower you in it.",

A lot of young folks out there believe that as long as they are born again, they do not need to belong to any local church, submit to a spiritual head, or serve under a ministry.

If all you do is the online church and you do not participate in any system of the church, your growth will be very limited. Serving God as a believer is what helps your spiritual growth. Most times, what makes many believers run away from serving in their local church is pride. If you are too proud to serve, you are too small to lead. Don’t be too proud to do the little things in the church. Some are so full of Rhema that once their pastor does not give them a role on the pulpit, they are too big to serve in other systems like sanitation, welfare, media, or any places where they can’t be seen.",

            "Activities may not necessarily lead to spiritual growth but you cannot grow without activities. Your light cannot shine without serving others, especially believers. Isolating yourself from others is not spiritual maturity, it is spiritual pride. Some will say they do not want any trouble from church people, well this is also a sign of carnality. Labouring in the vine is part of serving and working with others. Though we are sons, we are also servants of God. Paul noted that one of the signs of spiritual maturity is serving as a teacher in the church. To grow, commit yourself to serve in a local church. Submit to a spiritual head to whom you are accountable. Find a department in the church to work with. Use your gifts and skills for the furtherance of the church. As you do this, you will grow in love and Christ. Your online church must not replace a local church.",

Never forget how God provided or healed you because that is what will boost your faith in times of lack and sickness. Keep a good memory of God’s intervention in your life.

I have seen many believers who were very fervent just before their visitation and breakthrough came. Immediately God blessed them, they disappeared from the church. These are forgetters.

Don’t allow what you think God didn’t do make you forget all He has done. Saul forgot how much being chosen as a king meant to him.

But the moment they receive their answered prayer, they suddenly forget everything. This is why you must document your encounters and testimonies. Write them down in your note, on the wall of your house, and name something after it. And you must go back often to read them so that you can trigger that emotion afresh.

Every mistake you make can lead you to the right place in life. Your mind effortlessly focuses on the bad memories and ignores the good ones. You must realize that mistakes and failures are parts of life. You are likely to make more before you leave this world. Therefore, focusing on regrets only drains your energy and robs you of the opportunities ahead.",

            "To deal with regrets, you must learn to be grateful for them. Believe that all things work together for your good. Moreover, nothing happened to you that caught God unaware. God has a way of turning your mess into a message. He has a way of using your problems for your profits. Learn to learn from your mistakes and move on. What lies before you is far greater than what lies behind you. Always picture your desired future whenever the regrets come into your heart. The best of God for you is in your future, not in your past.  Don’t allow the mistakes of the past to ruin the glories of today and tomorrow. As long as you keep rehearsing the past chapter of your life, you will not know what’s in the next chapter. Whatever God has done in the past is nothing compared to what He wants to do in the future.",

            "Many times we pray very hard, but when God gives us instructions, we ignore it because we are ignorant of the fact that our answered prayer is in that instruction. This is because of the wrong mindset many Christians have towards prayers and answered prayers. We put all the responsibility on God and we expect to do nothing ourselves. If you don’t understand how God answers your prayer, you will miss the answer when it comes. The woman in our text could have walked away from the prophet easily.",

            "The wife of one of the sons of the prophet prayed to God for a miracle. But Elisha asked her two questions. “What can I do for you? And What do you have? The first question puts the responsibility of the solution on Elisha (God) and the other on the woman (you). Most believers will answer the first but the woman answered the latter. You must know that you are part of God’s miracle process. Your miracles do not rest on God only. If it were so, everyone would have their miracles. You also have a role to play.",

          textThree:
            "This was followed by a series of instructions that the woman must adhere to for her to get her miracle. Her answer came in the form of instructions. Also, your miracles are hidden in your obedience to certain instructions because God has done everything He needs to do already. So when you pray, He only needs to open your eyes to what He has done and what you need to do to get what you prayed for. The woman already had the oil, that little boy already had the five bread and 2 fish, and Moses already had the rod. All God gave them was instructions on how to use these items.",
